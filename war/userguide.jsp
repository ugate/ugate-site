												Determine how to wire the IR receiver pins. Here we used a spare
												8-pin header and soldered the pins to the pins of the IR receiver
												so we can easily change the jumper cables out as needed. One
												advantage to this approach that we will see later is that it fits
												nicely in the electrical flex tubing. A 3 color LED has also been
												soldered to some of the remaining header pins that will be used to
												indicate whether or not keys entered using the universal remote
												are being received. We used a 3 color LED to indicate when a
												remote control command is accepted (green), rejected (red),
												executing (blue), or access keys are being entered (white).

												<b>Step 2:</b>
												We need to have a durable see-through enclosure to house our IR

												The spice jars length is long enough to prevent the camera dome
												from getting in the way of our receiver and the diameter allows a
												snug fit for the flexible electrical tube to fit in.

												be used to hold the IR receiver in place so it isn't dangling
												around in the spice jar. It also makes the project look nicer
												because the wires aren't exposed inside the jar. You may have

												and drill a hole centering it on the brass insert. The brass
												insert is very soft so it will be reduced to shavings.

												<b>Step 7:</b>
												To make space for the servo to be inserted into the bottom of the
												base we need to completely remove the nub so the center hole is
												flush with the rest of the base. To do this use a 1/2 inch drill
												bit and center it on the hole we drilled on the other side.
												Periodically place the servo gear through the hole on the bottom
												of the base where you are drilling to see if it can reach the horn
												connection on the other side where we drilled the first hole. If
												you get a good connection you can stop drilling.

												black screw used to secure the horn to the servo. Place the rubber
												ring into the camera dome bracket where the original screw used to
												be. Now place the servo screw into the rubber ring and screw it
												into the horn/servo (Tip: using the large hole on the top of the
												camera dome bracket makes it easier to screw it onto the servo).
												Again, we want the assembly to be very loose between the camera
												dome base and the bracket/horn/servo mount. When it gets secured
												to the junction box it wont seem as loose.

												do not overlap the edges of the junction box. The long side of the
												servo should be facing the front of the junction box and the gear
												side of the servo should be facing the opposite side of the spice
												jar. Mark the rectangular edges of the servo on the junction box
												with a marker/pen/pencil. Disassemble.

												<b>Step 11:</b>
												Being careful not to cut the long side too far (needed to screw in
												the servo), cut the rectangular hole for the servo with rotary
												tool cutting disk. For better results you may want to use a 1/2
												inch drill bit to drill out the four corners before using the
												rotary tool. Using the silver screws that came with the servo,
												mount the screws to the servo inside the junction box (you may
												have to drill a pilot hole).

												Next, center the camera dome base on the mounted servo gear that
												is sticking out of the junction box and push the round servo horn
												over the servo gear trying not to have the sides of the horn
												touching the camera dome base. Make sure that one of the two
												larger holes in the camera dome base is facing the back of the
												junction box (they will be used to run the tilt servo wires and
												the camera wires and will need to be in the back to keep them out
												of the way while the camera is panning). Use the 11/64 inch drill
												bit to drill the four holes that will secure the camera dome base
												to the junction box. Screw in the four 1/2 inch x 11/64 screws
												into the camera dome base to the junction box. Also, use the 1/2
												inch drill to expand the larger hole in the back to the junction
												box where the wires will be ran. Caulk around the perimeter of the
												camera dome base where it joins the junction box using the outdoor
												caulk to create a weather-tight seal.

												<b>Step 13:</b>
												Now we need to assemble the tilt servo. First we need to glue the
												tilt servo to the top portion of the camera dome bracket. Unscrew
												the top black mount from the bottom bracket base that connects to
												the camera dome base. The servo should be placed on the opposite
												side from the four screws that the camera circuit mounts to (where
												the large round hole is). The servos center point should be inline
												with the hole for the screw in the top bracket. This means the
												gear will be slightly offset from the hole for the screw on the
												bracket- this is what we want. Use a hot-glue gun to glue the
												servo to the top bracket (a generous amount of glue!). You may
												also want to add glue on the opposite side around the perimeter of
												the large hole.
												<b>IMPORTANT: Make sure the the servo horn arm is facing toward
													the top (as seen in the photo) and the gear is in it's farthest
													position toward the top. This can be accomplished by gently
													rotating the horn until it will no longer rotate toward the top
													position. This is a zero degree angle that needs to be set in

											<p>
												<b>Step 14:</b>
												Using the single arm servo horn, the two arm servo horn, and the
												two silver mounting screws that came with the servo we can make a
												lever arm for tilting the camera. Place the single arm horn onto
												the servo we just glued on, but do NOT use the small black screw
												that came with the servo to secure it (ignore image for the
												moment). Take the two arm horn and one of the silver mounting
												screws and screw it into the last hole in the two arm horn and
												through the last hole in the single arm horn. Make sure the two
												arm horn has the servo gear connection facing away from the
												bracket so it doesn't get in the way of the lever assembly. Using
												a 3/32 inch drill bit, drill a hole on the side of the bracket
												base toward the bottom closest to the servo. Use the other silver
												screw to connect the two arm horn through the last hole in the arm
												and into the hole we just drilled in bracket base. Do not over
												tighten any of the screws. Mount the camera circuit that we
												removed from the enclosure to the bracket using the four screws
												that came in the bracket.
												<b>NOTE: Wires from the camera circuit should be on the bottom
													(contrary to the photo) unless you are mounting the camera on the
													top of the junction box.</b>

											<p>
												<b>Step 15:</b>
												Now That we have both the pan and tilt servos in place we need to
												calibrate their positioning to the desired angle of operation. To
												do so we need to do a preliminary setup to test out what we have
												done so far. Unscrew the screws that attach the top bracket to the
												bracket base and carefully bend the tilt lever back to expose the
												hole in the bracket base. Using the rubber ring and screw
												described in the previous steps, secure the bracket base to the
												round panning servo horn. Twist the camera and tilting servo wires
												and place them through the 1/2 hole we drilled in the junction
												box.

											<p>
												<b>Step 16:</b>
												We are now ready to setup our calibration test. Download the
												Arduino IDE (for chipKIT) from
												<a href="https://github.com/chipKIT32/chipKIT32-MAX/downloads"
													rel="nofollow">here</a>
												and follow the directions for installation. Once installed open
												the Arduino application. It will give you a blank sketch. Copy the
												following code and paste it into the sketch. This code basically
												just tilts the camera up and down, pans the cam left to right, and
												repeats the process indefinitely. It has a slight delay that will
												allow you to push the camera mount to the left or right to
												establish the correct panning span required for your particular
												project. Use the diagram above to wire your Arduino accordingly.
												Connect your USB cable from the Arduino to your computer and click
												on the Upload button at the top of the Arduino IDE. Wait until it
												says "Done uploading..." at the bottom and you should see the
												camera start to pan/tilt.

											<b>Step 17:</b>
											You may have to adjust the tilting single arm horn so that it is
											tilting properly by taking it off the servo gear and moving it up
											or down a notch or two. Unplug the USB cable, do the adjustment,
											and plug the USB cable back in. Do this until tilting occurs
											similar to the video above. Also, we may need to push the camera
											left or right to get the panning angle span you desire (this can be
											done while the USB is plugged in). For instance, we don't want the
											camera to pan all the way in front of the IR spice jar enclosure.
											You may want it to pan farther to the side opposite to the IR
											enclosure? Once the tilt and pan is calibrated to the desired
											angles we are ready to hot-glue the round servo horn to the bracket
											base (NOTE: make sure when you unplug the USB cable that you do not
											move the bracket to the left or right or your pan calibration will
											not be locked into place).
											<b>NOTE: Wires from the camera circuit should be on the bottom
												(contrary to the video) unless you are mounting the camera on the
												top of the junction box.</b>

												<b>Step 18:</b>
												Repeat the same procedure we performed in
												<b>Step 15</b>
												where we unscrewed the two top bracket screws and extended the
												tilting lever to gain access to the screw that connects the
												bracket base to the round panning servo horn. This time we want to
												remove the screw being careful not to move the bracket base
												undoing the calibration we just did. Lift the bracket base
												assembly off of the servo horn noting (and possibly marking) the
												orientation of the camera relative to the round servo horn (do not
												remove the horn, just the bracket assembly). Use the hot-glue gun
												to glue the bracket assembly to the round servo horn. Use the
												rubber ring and screw we removed to secure the base to the horn.
												Now, if we ever have to remove the bracket assembly we can unscrew
												the horn from the panning servo lifting it off of the junction
												box.

												<b>Step 19:</b>
												If we leave the original screws in that hold the top camera
												mounting bracket they may tighten when tilting occurs. Also, the
												camera dome insert that resides just under the clear camera dome
												needs to turn with the camera as we pan so the opening is always
												centered with the camera lens. We accommodate both of these tasks
												by removing the two screws that hold the top bracket onto the
												bottom bracket base and run a long wire through both holes that
												extend out into the dome insert. When the camera pans the wire
												shaft will turn the dome insert while holding the top bracket onto
												the bracket base. You can use either 18 gauge wire or
												<a href="http://ugate.googlecode.com/files/cam-shaft-wire.jpg"
													rel="nofollow">a wire necklace from Michaels arts &amp; craft store</a>
												bent/cut to size. Obviously, the stronger the wire the better. The
												servos also came with a couple screw sleeves (shown above). We
												will use these to hold the wire shaft in place while its inside
												the dome insert.

											<b>Step 20:</b>
											First, remove the two screws that hold the top bracket to the

											through the bracket base into the top bracket (where the screw used
											to be). Push it all the way through to the opposite side where the
											second screw used to be. You should now have a wire shaft sticking
											out both ends. Take one of the screw sleeves and hot-glue it to the
											inside wall of the dome insert about a 1/2 inch from the bottom of
											the dome insert so it lines up with the shaft when its setting on
											the dome base (there is very little clearance for pushing the
											sleeve through a hole from the outside- ignore those holes in the
											video). Slightly squeeze the dome insert from the front and back so
											the wire shaft can rest inside the sleeves we just glued into
											place. Twist the clear dome over the dome insert and onto the dome
											base.Rerun the code outlines in
											<b>Step 16</b>
											to ensure the insert is rotating as the camera is panning. If the
											camera lens is hitting the top of the dome when tilting up, add a
											few washers in-between the screw holes on the panning servo and the
											junction box. This should lower the camera assembly enough to avoid
											this if its an issue.

												<b>Step 1:</b>
												Due to the nature of X-Band microwave signals it can detect
												movement/speed through solid non-metallic objects such as walls
												(keep in mind that although it can detect motion from side to side
												it is more sensitive to motion moving toward/away from the device-
												similar to K-Band police radar). For this reason we can place the
												microwave sensor in the 4x4x4 junction box with minimal impact on
												the signal. The first thing we need to do is drill a hole in the
												center of the bottom of the 4x4x4 junction box using a 1/2 inch
												drill bit. This will be where the round portion of the servo just
												under the gear head will go (you may have to cut an additional
												notch on one side of the hole for it to fit). Once drilled, align
												the 4x4x4 box on the 6x6x4 box on the opposite end of the camera
												dome. Make sure the cover is on the 6x6x4 box when doing this to
												make sure the 4x4x4 box doesn't get in the way of it closing. Use
												a marker to mark the hole we just drilled through the 4x4x4 box
												onto the 6x6x4 box. This will be where the servo horn will
												protrude.

									</td>
									<td>
										<img src="http://ugate.googlecode.com/files/mw02.jpg">
											<p>
												<b>Step 2:</b>
												Next, using one of the servos and a marker, trace around the servo
												while keeping the gear head centered on the mark drawn in
												<b>Step 1</b>
												. Make sure the servo body (opposite of the gear head) is pointing
												to the left of the 6x6x4 box (while looking at the 6x6x4 box
												opening). This will ensure that the orientation used in the
												program will be the same as the servo. Use a rotary tool with a
												cutting disk to cut out the traced edge being careful not to cut
												too far- we need the area to mount the servo screws. Mount the
												servo on the inside of the 6x6x4 box using the two silver screws
												provided with it (you can also use the two rubber washer provided
												if desired). Use a generous amount of outdoor silicone based caulk
												in between the two boxes to create a watertight seal. Once the
												servo is mounted and the caulk has dried, drill another 1/2 inch
												hole in the bottom, adjacent to the center hole drilled in
												<b>Step 1</b>
												. The hole should be orientated so the new hole is facing the back
												of the 4x4x4 box and should be drilled all the way through to the
												adjoining 6x6x4 box. This hole will allow the sensor wiring to be
												ran from the 4x4x4 box into the 6x6x4 box. Also, it might be a
												good idea to drill additional holes to affix some nuts/bolts to
												hold the 4x4x4 to the 6x6x4 box. This is optional, however, seeing
												that we are caulking the boxes together.

												<b>Step 3:</b>
												Now that we have the junction boxes joined and the servo in place
												we can create the shield for the microwave sensor. You may have
												noticed that the circuit has 4 microstrip antennas built into it
												(opposite side from the sensitivity potentiometer). The 2 on the
												left are transmit and the 2 on the right are receive antennas. The
												device was designed with a broad beam pattern that will cover most
												of the areas surrounding the device in both the vertical and
												horizontal directions. In order to shield the signal so it will
												detect signals that are coming from the front of the device. The
												sausage can will work nicely for this as it meets the constraints
												of the junction box as well as the sensor. Keep in mind that while
												the sensor is within the can it will still detect motion to
												approximately 90 degrees from the opening. Also, because the can
												made of
												<b>thin</b>
												aluminum it will still detect motion from the sides and back of
												the can that are within a few feet. Consider that a tamper
												avoidance mechanism ;) Since the sensor has some exposed leads we
												don't want them to be shorted when we place it in the can. For
												this purpose line the interior of the can with several layers of
												electrical tape. Drill a hole for the square
												<font color="blue">blue</font>
												potentiometer to reside. Using a rotary tool and a cutting disk
												cut a slot on the side of the can near the bottom for the female
												jumper wires. Take the 2, 3/4 x 1/8 inch screws and screw them
												into the bottom of the can using the
												<u>third</u>
												indented ring as a guide (should line up with the mounting holes
												on the microwave sensor). Place the sensor into the can with the
												potentiometer facing the bottom of the can until the potentiometer
												is showing through the bottom of the can and the two screws are
												secured through the sensors mounting holes.

												<b>Step 4:</b>
												Using some pliers to hold the base of the conduit hanger (opposite
												end of the nut/blot) bend the two hanger ends open so the shield
												can will fit through the two hanger ends. The pliers are used to
												ensure that the mounting hole on the base of the hanger doesn't
												bow while bending the hanger ends. Next, take a round servo horn
												(comes with servo) and a hot glue gun and glue it in place in the
												round mounting hole on the hanger base with the gear connection
												facing down (away from the hanger ends). After the glue has dried
												(usually around 5 minutes) place the hanger base down into the
												4x4x4 junction box and join the servo horn to the servo gear head.
												Gently rotate the servo/horn/hanger
												<b>clockwise</b>
												until the servo will not turn anymore. This should be your
												<b>zero</b>
												angle rotational position. If the hanger ends are not facing the
												front and back of the 6x6x4 box, lift the hanger off the servo and
												rotate it until it does. This orientation will be a
												<b>zero</b>
												degree rotational position where the can opening will be facing
												the left of the 6x6x4 box. As it rotates to
												<b>180</b>
												degrees the opening of the can will be facing the right of the
												box. Use the
												<b>black</b>
												screw that came with the servo to secure the horn to the servo.
												Place the can through the top of the bent hanger ends. Making sure
												that the can is centered between the hanger ends, squeeze the ends
												close together and secure the nut/bolt through the hole (this may
												cause a slight bend in the can as it's diameter is slightly over 2
												inches).

												Next we need an weather tight compartment for our PIR and Sonar
												sensors. An outdoor single bulb floodlight will do the job. It's
												lightweight aluminum construction will prevent rust and keep UV

												<b>Step 2:</b>
												Remove the white PIR lens dome from the PIR sensor. The silver PIR
												sensing element should appear under the lens. We decided to remove
												the actual sensor element from the PIR PCB board so we can mount
												the PCB in a more readily accessible location inside the junction
												box. That way if we need to adjust the sensitivity and time pots
												(typically label on the PCB) we can do so without taking apart our
												PIR/Sonar armature. Using a de-soldering iron remove the silver
												PIR element by gently sucking the solder on the three element
												pins. Be careful not to touch the gray element window in the
												process. Next take three short male to male jumper wires and
												solder them into three holes where the element used to be mounted.
												It should look something like the illustration above. You may also
												need to trim the excess jumper pin so it will lay flat when we
												mount it in a later step (illustration does not show it trimmed
												yet).

												<b>Step 3:</b>
												Now we want to do a similar thing to the Sonar PCB that we did to
												the PIR PCB. There are two pins and should be labeled with a plus
												symbol and a minus symbol. We need to ensure we do not reverse
												these two pins when we reconnect them. For that reason you may
												notice that we used a permanent marker to label them (the positive
												pin is usually longer than the negative pin). The round black
												sensor element on the reverse side of the PCB is what sends and
												receives the ultrasonic signal we use to detect the distance an
												object is from our security device. Using a de-soldering iron,
												remove the black sonar element from the PCB. Take two short male
												to male jumper wires and solder them into the same holes where we
												removed the black sensor element from. You may also need to trim
												the excess jumper pin so it will lay flat when we mount it in a
												later step. It should like something like the illustration above.

												<b>Step 5:</b>
												Now we need to create a weatherproof cap that will fit in our
												floodlight holder. We used a piece of plexiglass, but any UV
												resistant plastic will work. It doesn't have to be transparent,
												but it will help when marking the holes to cut into it. Using a 1
												and 3/4 inch hole saw cut a round section of plexiglass. Place the
												PIR lens on top of the round plexiglass closest to either side to
												ensure there will be room for the sonar element. On the reverse
												side of the round plexiglass cutout mark the locations of the four
												PIR lens prongs. Using a 1/16 inch drill bit, drill all four prong
												holes that we just marked. Fasten the PIR lens into the four prong
												holes that were just drilled. Flip the plexiglass cutout over and
												mark the center where the PIR element will be placed (hint: there
												should be a small plastic mark in the center of the lens that you
												can use as a reference when marking the center point). Using a
												1/16 inch drill bit, drill the pilot hole for the PIR element-
												then use a 3/8 inch drill bit to drill the final hole where the
												element will be mounted. Next, place the black sonar element on
												the plexiglass cutout on the same side as the PIR lens. The lens
												and sonar element should span the diameter of the plexiglass
												cutout. On the reverse side mark the placement of the two sonar
												pins and drill two holes that are marked with a 1/16 inch drill
												bit. Holding the sonar element in place solder two short male to
												male jumper wires to the two pins on the sonar element (make sure
												the solder expands into the holes to make a secure solder. It

												<b>Step 8:</b>
												The floodlight holder is a little too long for our servos to
												handle so to make it a little more compact and to provide an area
												to mount the tilting servo we decided to cut it down to size using
												a rotary drill with a cutting attachment. The cast aluminum holder
												is thin and soft enough to easily make the cut. Using a
												screwdriver remove the ceramic bulb fixture. Also remove the
												rubber insert ring. Cut along the diameter of the floodlight
												holder using the rotary drill about 2 and a half inches from its
												opening- leaving about a 1 inch wide by 1 and a half inch tall
												section to mount the tilting servo horn to (see illustrations in
												later steps to get a visual on the cut). Once cut, use the
												exterior grade caulk to line the groove of the floodlight holder
												just inside the opening where the light bulb would normally rest
												(where the rubber insert ring was). Now place the plexiglass
												cutout into the floodlight holder with the PIR lens/sonar element
												facing out. Put another layer of caulk to secure the plexiglass
												cutout to the floodlight holder. Make sure there are no holes
												remaining that would allow moisture to penetrate the plexiglass
												cutout. It should look something like the illustration above.

												<b>Step 9:</b>
												Next, take one of the micro servos and a single arm horn that came
												with it and mount it to the floodlight holder sidewall so that the
												servo is facing the inside of the holder. To do this we need to
												drill a 1/16 inch hole where the small black screw that came with
												the servo will go and another similar sized hole that will line up
												with the center hole on the servo horn. Use the black screw to
												secure the floodlight holder to the servo horn and into the servo
												itself. Use a silver screw that came with the servo to mount the
												center hole on the servo horn to the floodlight holder. It may be
												necessary to cut a portion of the silver screw if it interferes
												with the rotation of the servo. It should look similar to the
												illustration above.
												<b>IMPORTANT: Make sure the the servo horn arm is facing toward
													the top and the gear is in it's farthest position toward the top
													(similar to the orientation of the servo in step 13 of the Camera
													Dome Assembly).</b>

												the lower left outside corner of the junction box cover. Make sure
												it does not overlap the seal/screw track on the reverse side of

												the PIR/sonar panning servo from
												<b>Step 10</b>

												use some screws with smaller heads) mount the knockout onto the
												cover (you may have to use a 1/16 inch drill bit to drill a pilot

											There are many universal remotes to choose from with many types of

											, NEC TC101 etc.). Instead of trying to accommodate all of the
											protocols and considering the availability of programmable
											universal remotes it's easier just to stick with one. This project
											uses the
											<i>Sony SIRC</i>
											protocol (if you'd like to use a different protocol or would like

											<a
												href="http://www.arcfn.com/2009/08/multi-protocol-infrared-remote-library.html"
												rel="nofollow">this link</a>
											will get you started).
											<i>Sony SIRC</i>
											can be 12, 15, or 20 bit. 12 bit codes have been chosen to reduce
											the number of pulses that have to be decoded (NOTE: If your remote
											will not accept the code you should be able to choose any code that
											is 12 bit). Also, each universal remote code is setup to use or not
											use optional features on your remote control.

							A security system wouldn't be very secure without an access code. So,
							by default to operate any of the features of the remote control a
							<b>3</b>
							-digit code must be entered before UGate functions can be accessed. On
							first upload of the ugate.pde to your Arduino the access code will
							default to
							<b>123</b>
							. When the
							<b>3</b>
							-digit code is entered in sequence it will unlock the UGate functions
							described in the table above. Successful access code entries are
							indicated by a blue or green flashing LED. Unsuccessful attempts will
							cause the red LED to blink. Access to the UGate functions will be
							available until the
							<b>Mute</b>
							button is pressed or the access code has timed out (default session
							timeout is
							<u>
								<b>30 seconds</b>
							</u>
							). Once the proper access code has been entered and accepted it can be
							changed by pressing the
							<b>Input</b>
							button on the remote and entering your new
							<b>3</b>
							-digit code. After access has been granted, pressing any one of the
							predefined UGate function commands will place that command into a
							buffered queue with each command getting executed in the order it was
							received. There are a few important key points to remember when using
							the universal remote:

							The microwave sensor has a very broad beam pattern that will span most

							logical movement would be to limit it to panning. Even so, the device
							is housed in a junction box and is not visible. Therefore, there is no
							command that will pan the microwave sensor via the universal remote.
							However, the
							<a href="http://code.google.com/p/ugate/#UGate_GUI" rel="nofollow">GUI
								application</a>
							has a visual aid to indicate the direction the sensor is pointing to
							and can be adjusted accordingly.

							The Laser/IR Receiver position needs to be precise and should not be

							available pan/tilt angles until it finds the return signal from the
							pulsed laser or until it exhausts all available pan/tilt angles. Prior
							to calibration the reflective mirror should be aligned in the general
							direction of the Laser/IR Receiver.
